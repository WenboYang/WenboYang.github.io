title: Setup Subversion And Beyond Compare 4 On Cygwin

I have been using TortoiseSVN 1.6.16 Build 21511 for about 5 years, pretty happy about it. Recently, it seems our SVN server gets an update, and this broke my old TortoiseSVN's SSL handshake, I always got error info like this:

SSL handshake failed: Secure connection truncated.

OKAY then, maybe I should upgrade the TortoiseSVN client to a newer version, as my colleagues did. Before doing that, I want to try something else, recent experience with git command line makes me quite comfortable with the command line VCS workflow. So I decided to give the command line SVN a try.
